# funchisq-wrapper
Scala wrapper for running time series network inference using the Chi-Square test for functional dependency analysis, described in [Zhang and Song 2013]. This wrapper puts together two steps of the inference pipeline, using the original R implementations:
* First, data is discretized using [Ckmeans.1d.dp].
* Second, pairwise functional dependency analysis is performed using [FunChisq].
